### Day 32 – CSV Data Handling in Java
📅 (Date: 23-Jan-2026)
Worked on reading, writing, parsing, and validating structured data formats commonly used in real-world applications. Practiced end-to-end data handling using both core Java and popular libraries.
<br>Covered key concepts including:
- Reading and writing CSV files using BufferedReader/Writer
- Handling CSV data efficiently with OpenCSV
- Mapping CSV records to Java objects (CsvToBean)
- Validating CSV fields using regex and data checks

### Day 33 – JSON Data Handling in Java
📅 (Date: 24-Jan-2026)
Worked on reading, writing, parsing, and validating structured data formats commonly used in real-world applications. Practiced end-to-end data handling using both core Java and popular libraries.
<br>Covered key concepts including:
- Understanding JSON structure (objects, arrays, nested data)
- Creating, reading, writing, and parsing JSON using org.json, Gson, and Jackson
- Dynamic JSON parsing with JsonNode and JSON schema validation

### Day 34 – Scenario-Based Problems
📅 (Date: 27-Jan-2026)

<br><br>Solved real-world scenario-based problems involving advanced Java concepts:
- **HealthCheckPro** – Used custom annotations and reflection to scan API methods and auto-generate metadata/documentation
- **MarkMate** – Processed student marks from CSV files and generated JSON report cards with totals, averages, and grades
- **EventTracker** – Built an audit system using annotations and reflection to generate structured JSON logs for user actions

<br>Focused on practical usage of **Annotations, Reflection, CSV & JSON data handling**, and exception-safe design patterns.
