### Day 34 – Lambda Expressions & Method References in Java
📅 (Date: 27-Jan-2026)

Focused on understanding functional-style programming in Java using lambda expressions and method references. Practiced writing concise, readable code by replacing anonymous classes with lambdas and explored how Java infers types using target typing.

<br>Covered key concepts including:
- Lambda expression syntax (no parameter, single parameter, multiple parameters)
- Functional interfaces and target typing
- Type inference in lambda expressions
- Closures and effectively final variables
- Difference between lambda expressions and anonymous inner classes
- Using lambdas with Streams, Predicate, Comparator, and Runnable
