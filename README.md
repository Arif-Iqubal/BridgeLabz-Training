### Day 34 – Lambda Expressions & Method References in Java
📅 (Date: 27-Jan-2026)

Focused on understanding functional-style programming in Java using lambda expressions and method references. Practiced writing concise, readable code by replacing anonymous classes with lambdas and explored how Java infers types using target typing.

<br>Covered key concepts including:
- Lambda expression syntax (no parameter, single parameter, multiple parameters)
- Functional interfaces and target typing
- Type inference in lambda expressions
- Closures and effectively final variables
- Difference between lambda expressions and anonymous inner classes
- Using lambdas with Streams, Predicate, Comparator, and Runnable

### Day 35 – Interfaces & Functional Interfaces in Java
📅 (Date: 28-Jan-2026)

Practiced interface-based design and modern Java interface features.

<br>Covered:
- Defining and implementing interfaces
- Interface best practices and ISP
- Default and static methods
- Method conflict resolution
- Polymorphism and decoupling

<br><br>Functional Interfaces:
- SAM concept and @FunctionalInterface
- Built-in functional interfaces
- Custom functional interfaces
- Lambda compatibility (SAM conversion)

<br><br>Also explored marker interfaces vs annotations and common design pitfalls.
